<h1>Facts about some of the animes above(SPOILERS!!!)</h1>

<h3>Oshi No Ko</h3>
<p>The mangaka of Oshi No Ko, Aka Akasaka is also the mangaka of Kaguya-sama: Love is War.         Oshi No Ko was created by two mangakas.</p>

<h3>Mobile Suit Gundam:The Witch from Mercury</h3>
<p>There are light novels about the story. One of them is about before Suletta and Aerial went to school and one of them is around things that happened after ep4 and before ep5.</p>

<h3>Bocchi the Rock</h3>
<p>Bocchi the Rock is originally a four-panel manga.
Bocchi the Rock main characters' names are from a real-life rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation.</p>

<h3>That Time I got reincarnated as a Slime</h3>
<p>One of the villains, Demon Lord Clayman is voiced by Takehito Koyasu, the person that voiced Dio Brando from Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. That Time I got reincarnated as a Slime Coleus's No Yume (Coleus's Dream) came out a few days ago a left with a huge hint about Luminous Valentine and the mystry black hair women (which I think is the Masked Hero aka Chloe Aubert/Chronoa).</p>

<h3>That Time I got reincarnated as a Slime Diaries</h3>
<p>Although the anime of That Time I got reincarnated as a Slime Diaries ended, the manga actually contiued.</p>

<h3>Lycoris Recoil</h3>
<p>Lycoris Recoil is actually an original anime.
Most people watch Lycoris Recoil because they like to watch Chisato and Takina's relationship.</p>

<h3>Kagerou Daze/Kagerou Project/Mekakucity Actors</h3>
<p>Kagerou Daze, Kagerou Project and Mekakucity Actors are actually in different cycles. Kagerou Daze is the story from one of the cycle where everyone was killed to another cycle. Mekakucity Actors is in another cycle that seems to have a good ending. It's origin is actulally songs that were created by Jin to tell a story. Some of the most famous ones are "Ayano's Theory of Happines", "Children Record" and "Tomei Answers".<del>Personally I think "Ayano's Theory of Happiness" is the saddest. I also think that "Outer Science" is the best song in the whole album.</del></p>
